									<h1>About Me<br />
									</h1>
									<p>After more than six years of experience in the ﬁnancial sector, I entered the Madrid 42 Program, a high-performance campus to learn the most demanding professions in the technology industry from the foundations of programming. And make a Data Scientist specialisation.

										I am a doer, proactive and adaptive, eager to join a company to apply my extensive knowledge of data science and continue growing.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ABOUTME.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Although I studied law at UAM, and did a master's degree at labour law and human resources afterwards, it was clear to me that I didn't want to go into this field..</p>
								<p>This led me to go deeper in financial sector. Where I had contact with the world of data analysis, customer contact, sales, financial training, giving presentations and finally working as a team manager for more than 3 years.</p>
								<p>At this point, I decided that I wanted to change my profile to the technological world.</p>
								<p>Start, to join the Madrid 42 programme, a high-performance campus. To enter the school you have to pass the pool, a selection process of 26 consecutive days developing projects in C and facing challenges in a team. You get to work more than three hundred hours in that period of time.  A program of Fundación Telefónica.</p>
								<p>When I finished the admission process but didn’t know the result, a job offer came to me without looking for it, which I found interesting. This led to my last job while I was studying in the Madrid 42 programme and working at the same time.</p>
								<p>This is possible because 42 is a programming school with a disruptive methodology, based on peer-to-peer learning and the development of soft skills such as the desire to learn, adaptation to change and perseverance. The students of 42 have no teachers, we have at our disposal the facilities 24/7 and we learn through the development of projects, developed mainly in low-level languages, and without being able to make use of libraries, functions, etc., in order to have a deep knowledge that will allow us to easily adapt to the languages of the present and the future.</p>
								<p>I was hired as a Financial analyst of mortgage management.
									My role consisted of carrying out a financial analysis of the client for subsequent mortgage management by means of a detailed treatment of the client's assets and economic potential, comparing and analysing the national banking offer, in order to find the ideal mortgage offer for each individual client.
									</p>
								<p>I felt it was the best time  to accelerate my transformation into the tech world. Mostly to develop myself as a data scientist which involved depth as a data engineer, data analyst, knowledge in business intelligence and machine learning models.</p>
								<p>I did the data science bootcamp at The Bridge, where they have a highly intensive and deeply practical programme. I learned about</p>
								<p>- Programming: Python (IDEs: PyCharm, VisualStudio, Jupyter)
									- Version control: Git
									- Databases: SQL
									-Data sources: APIs, Web Scrapping (Selenium, BeautifulSoup)
									- EDA, Data analysis, data cleansing, data mining: Pandas, Numpy, SQL, Spark
									- Data Visualisation: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Plotly
									- Dashboarding: Power BI
									- Machine Learning: Supervised and unsupervised learning: Scikit-Learn (linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, PCA, SVM, KNN, tree- and set-based models, clustering algorithms... Machine Learning with PySpark and Databricks)
									- Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Transfer Learning, Embeddings)
									- Natural Language Processing: NLTK, SpaCy, Textacy
									- Big Data & ETL: Spark, Databricks, PySpark, AWS Cloud
									- Model Deployment: Flask, Heroku, AWS
									</p>
								<p>This is a summary of my life, the future is written in code.See you<p/>
